									<p>The authors of the paper "Time to change the CVSS?" criticise several characteristics of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) (FIRST, n.d.), including:<p>
									<ol>
										<li><strong><em>Over-reliance on metrics:</em></strong> The authors argue that CVSS focuses too much on assigning a numerical score to vulnerabilities without considering the context of the vulnerability or the specific environment in which it occurs.</li>
										<li><strong><em>Limited scope:</em></strong> CVSS only assesses the technical impact of a vulnerability and does not take into account other factors, such as the potential harm to business operations or the reputation of an organisation.</li>
										<li><strong><em>Lack of transparency:</em></strong> The authors suggest that the scoring system used to calculate the CVSS score is not transparent enough, making it difficult for users to understand how the score was calculated.</li>
										<li><strong><em>Inadequate granularity:</em></strong> The authors argue that the current CVSS scale, which ranges from 0 to 10, does not provide enough granularity to accurately assess a vulnerability's severity.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>I agree with the critique of the authors. While CVSS has become a widely used industry standard, it has several limitations that make it less effective at accurately assessing vulnerabilities. Several studies have shown that CVSS scores are not always reliable indicators of the risk associated with a vulnerability (FIRST, n.d.). For example, one study found that CVSS scores do not correlate well with the likelihood of an exploit being developed for a vulnerability (Hernandex, 2022)</p>
									<p>For alternatives to CVSS, the authors suggest using a risk-based approach, which takes into account the specific context of a vulnerability and its potential impact on an organisation. This approach is supported by several studies, which have found that risk-based approaches can provide a more accurate assessment of the likelihood and impact of a vulnerability (Sarewitz, et al., 2003). Using a risk-based approach, organisations can better prioritise their resources and focus on the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk to their operations.</p>
									<p>I believe that the criticisms of CVSS raised by the authors are valid and that a risk-based approach is a more effective alternative to CVSS. However, it is important to note that different organisations may have different risk profiles and may need to adapt their approach to vulnerability assessment accordingly. </p>

									<p>I agree with the assessment that CVSS has some limitations and criticisms. The non-transparent formula for calculating the score and the subjective nature of the qualitative answers to the Base score metrics can lead to inaccuracies in the severity rating. Moreover, the lack of evidence or justification for the formula and poor metric descriptions can result in inconsistent scoring by different assessors. These issues can limit the usefulness of CVSS as a proxy for risk and result in inappropriate prioritisation of security efforts.</p>
									<p>While there have been some alternative approaches to modifying CVSS, such as Bayesian networks (Xie, et al., 2010), Markov chain (Geyer, 1992), and VPR (Tai, 2020), it is important to consider the practicality and feasibility of implementing these approaches in real-world scenarios. (Spring, et al., 2021) suggest that more research is needed to refine and improve the CVSS scoring system to provide transparent and justifiable results.</p>
									<p>It is worth noting that while CVSS may have its limitations, it still provides a common framework for rating the severity of vulnerabilities in the IT industry. Therefore, until a more comprehensive and widely accepted approach is developed, CVSS can still be used to assess the severity of vulnerabilities in a standardised manner. However, its limitations and potential inaccuracies should be kept in mind when using it to prioritise security efforts.</p>

									<p>Steve, thank you most kindly for your analysis of the CVSS system and the criticism levied against it. It is important to recognise the limitations of any system, especially one that is used widely in cybersecurity.</p>
									<p>The criticism regarding the assumption of a linear relationship between CVSS scores and risk and the questionable statistical techniques used to derive numerical values from ordinal data are valid points. It is important to consider the limitations of any system that attempts to quantify risk (DNV, n.d.).</p>
									<p>The lack of information about the process used to collect the data for the CVS equation is also a concern, as this could impact the validity of the results. Additionally, the fact that the system does not account for organisational context or the effects of vulnerabilities being chained together further limits its usefulness.</p>
									<p>The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) you mentioned as an alternative to the CVSS system is an interesting option. However, the fact that the underpinning code and data for the model are not available for critique is a concern, as transparency and openness are important in cybersecurity.</p>
									<p>Overall, it is important to recognise the limitations of any system used to quantify risk and to consider multiple approaches when making decisions about cybersecurity.</p>

									<strong><h3>Initial Post</h3></strong>
									<p>About my Initial Post dated Monday, 1st May 2023 (Initial Post, 2023), I mentioned four characteristics of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System that were criticised by the authors of the paper “Time to Change the CVSS?”; that outline its Over-Reliance on metrics to assign a numerical score to vulnerabilities; its Limited Scope of assessing the technical impact of a vulnerability with no consideration to business operations, its Lack of transparency which makes it difficult to understand how the score was calculated and Inadequate Granularity in the scoring system used to calculate a CVSS score.
									Although CVSS is a widely used Industry standard (Rhett, 2019) several studies have shown that CVSS has several limitations and is sometimes considered not a reliable indicator of risk, which I have found to agree with the authors. When comparing CVSS to Risk-Based Assessments, the risk-based approach showed a more accurate assessment of the likelihood and impact of a vulnerability and was suggested by the authors.</p>
									<strong><h3>Peer Response I</h3></strong>
									<p>Stella Williams (Peer Response, 2023) wrote in her Peer Response (Initial Post, 2023) on Tuesday, 2nd May 2023, agreeing that the criticism raised by the authors was valid and that the risk-based approach is a more effective alternative than the CVSS system which only assesses the technical impact of a vulnerability and not the factors that can harm organisation operations or reputation. Although Stella agrees with the author’s critics, she feels that there has been a considerable improvement in the four CVSS characteristics I mentioned in my Initial Post (Initial Post, 2023). Stella concluded that while acknowledging the limitations of CVSS, the current version of the CVSS system addresses many of the issues faced previously and still serves a vital role in vulnerability assessments as studies have demonstrated the system’s effectiveness.</p>
									<strong><h3>Peer Response II</h3></strong>
									<p>In the Peer Response written by Matjaz Galicic on Thursday, 4th May 2023 (Peer Response, 2023), Matjaz also agreed that the risk-based approach was efficient and should be used with other risk management frameworks to address the business needs or impact on an organisation’s operations.</p>
									<strong><h3>Conclusion</h3></strong>
									<p>Both peer responses agreed with the author’s critics of the CVSS system and its lack of transparency in assessing risk assessments. Although there has been an improvement in the current version of the CVSS system that addresses many of the previous issues faced, its In-Flight Proposals should make CVSS the overall risk-assessment methodology for the vulnerability assessment process used by organisations and individuals (D, n.d.). While CVSS is undergoing many new industry recommendations, both peer responses agreed that the risk-based approach was more effective in assessing technical and organisational risk assessments and should be used alongside other risk frameworks until better alternatives are available such as risk-based assessment or the current CVSS version (4.0) is finalised.</p>
